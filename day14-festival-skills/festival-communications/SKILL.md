## Request Lead Times

**Know these by heart - saves last-minute panic!**

| Request Type | Minimum Time Needed | Notes |
|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| 🖨️ Poster changes | 2 hours | Print shop needs prep time |
| 📱 Social media posts | 15 minutes | Only if content is provided |
| 📰 Press inquiries | N/A | Route to Festival Director - NEVER speak on record |
| 🏷️ Sponsor logo additions | Varies | Check contract first - some have exclusivity |

### Last-Minute Request Decision Tree

```
Request comes in:
├── Is it social media with content ready?
│   └── YES → Can do in 15 minutes
├── Is it a print request?
│   └── Need 2+ hours, check with print shop
├── Is it a sponsor/logo change?
│   └── Check contract for exclusivity first
└── Is it press related?
    └── Route to Festival Director immediately
```

## Press & Media Relations

### The Golden Rule

**NEVER speak on record without Festival Director approval!**

### When Press Contacts You

1. **Be polite but brief**: "Thanks for reaching out!"
2. **Don't answer questions**: "Let me connect you with the right person"
3. **Get their info**: Name, outlet, deadline, topic
4. **Route immediately**: Festival Director handles all press
5. **Don't speculate**: Even "off the record" isn't safe

### Approved Responses

| Situation | Say This |
|-----------|----------|
| General inquiry | "I'll have our Festival Director contact you. Can I get your info?" |
| Urgent/breaking | "I understand the urgency. Let me get the right person immediately." |
| Pushy reporter | "I'm not authorized to comment. The Festival Director will reach out." |

## Emergency Communications

### Order of Operations Matters!

#### Weather Delays
```
Post to ALL channels SIMULTANEOUSLY:
- [ ] Website banner
- [ ] Social media (all platforms)
- [ ] Email list
- [ ] PA announcement on-site
```

#### Event Cancellations
```
1. Email ticket holders FIRST (they paid!)
2. THEN public announcement
3. Social media + website
4. Update voicemail/phone message
```

#### Good News / Announcements
```
1. Social media first (builds buzz)
2. Email newsletter follows
3. Press release if major
```

### Emergency Message Templates

**Weather Delay:**

## Sponsor Management

### Before Adding a Logo

1. **Check the contract** for:
   - Exclusivity clauses (e.g., "only beverage sponsor")
   - Placement requirements
   - Size requirements
   - Approval process

2. **Conflicts to watch**:
   - Competing brands in same category
   - Exclusive sponsors being diluted
   - Logo placement hierarchy

3. **When in doubt**: Ask Festival Director before promising anything
