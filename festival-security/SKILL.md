## Vendor Management

### Before They Set Up

| Vendor Type | Required Before Setup |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 🍔 Food Vendors | Health permit verification - NO EXCEPTIONS |
| 🎪 All Vendors | 50% payment received |
| 🔊 Music/Sound | Noise level agreement signed |
| 🎨 Artisans | Liability waiver on file |

### Noise Complaint Escalation

This is a **3-strike system**:

```
Strike 1: VERBAL WARNING
   → Politely ask them to lower volume
   → Document time and conversation

Strike 2: WRITTEN WARNING  
   → Formal written notice
   → Explain next step is shutdown
   → Both parties sign

Strike 3: SHUTDOWN
   → Vendor must cease music/noise immediately
   → May continue selling quietly
   → Note in vendor file for future events
```

### Vendor Disputes

**Never take sides publicly!**

1. Separate the parties
2. Move discussion to back office
3. Hear both sides privately
4. Mediate a solution
5. Document outcome
6. Follow up with both parties later

### Payment Issues

- **Rule: 50% upfront, balance day-of**
- No exceptions without Festival Director approval
- Cash or card accepted
- Provide receipt for all payments
- Chase outstanding balances BEFORE next event
