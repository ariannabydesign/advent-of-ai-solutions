## Customer Experience (Madame Zelda's Expertise)

### Handling Difficult Customers

1. **Always acknowledge their frustration first** - Validate their feelings before problem-solving
2. **Offer alternatives, never just say "no"** - Find a way to help
3. **20+ minute wait rule** - Bump them up with a "VIP reading" to recover the experience
4. **Skeptics** - Use the "mysterious stranger" fortune style - it wins them over every time
5. **Kids under 10** - Use the "adventure quest" style - parents love it

### Keeping Lines Moving

- **Fortunes: 2-3 minutes max** - Keep it snappy
- **Chatty customers** - Offer an "extended reading" slot for later
- **Rush periods** - Always have 5 pre-written fortunes ready to go

## Security & Vendor Relations (Marcus's Expertise)

### Vendor Management

| Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Food vendors | Check health permits BEFORE setup, not after |
| Noise complaints | 1st: Verbal warning - 2nd: Written warning - 3rd: Shutdown |
| Vendor disputes | Never take sides publicly, mediate in the back office |
| Payment | 50% upfront required, balance due day-of |

### Emergency Codes

| Code | Situation | Protocol |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Code Yellow** | Lost child | All exits notify, broadcast description |
| **Code Blue** | Medical emergency | Clear path to medical tent, call 911 |
| **Code White** | Weather emergency | Announce shelter locations, secure loose items |
| **Code Orange** | Suspicious activity | Security team converges, DO NOT confront alone |

## Lost & Found (Maria's Expertise)

### Intake Process

1. **Photo EVERYTHING** before storing
2. **Tag with**: item description, location found, time, finder's name
3. **High-value items** (phones, wallets, jewelry) go in locked cabinet
4. **Perishables** (food, drinks) dispose after 2 hours

### Matching Process

1. Ask claimants to **describe item BEFORE showing it**
2. **Check ID** for high-value items
3. **Log all claims** (successful AND unsuccessful)
4. **30-day rule** - Unclaimed items go to charity

### Where to Look First

| Area | Common Lost Items |
|------|-------------------|
| Ice rink | Mittens and scarves |
| Food court | Phones and wallets (people put them down to eat) |
| Kids areas | Stuffed animals (URGENT - kids are devastated!) |

---

## Marketing & Communications (Elena's Expertise)

### Request Lead Times

| Request | Minimum Time Needed |
|---------|---------------------|
| Poster changes | 2 hours (print shop) |
| Social media posts | 15 minutes (if content provided) |
| Press inquiries | Route to Festival Director - NEVER speak on record |
| Sponsor logo additions | Check contract first - some have exclusivity |

### Emergency Communications Order

1. **Weather delays** - Post to ALL channels simultaneously
2. **Event cancellations** - Email ticket holders FIRST, then public announcement
3. **Good news** - Social media first, email newsletter follows

---

## Quick Decision Guide

### Someone's Upset?

1. Listen and acknowledge - "I understand this is frustrating"
2. Apologize for their experience - "I'm sorry this happened"
3. Offer a solution - "Here's what I can do..."
4. Follow up - "Did that resolve things for you?"

### Not Sure What To Do?

1. Safety issue? Handle immediately, escalate to security
2. Customer issue? Use APOLOGIZE + ALTERNATIVES approach
3. Vendor issue? Never public confrontation, use back office
4. Media/Press? Route to Festival Director, say nothing on record

## Escalation Contacts

- **Festival Director** - All press inquiries, major incidents, VIP issues
- **Security Lead** - All Code situations, vendor shutdowns, safety concerns
- **Medical Tent** - Any health-related emergencies
- **Back Office** - Vendor disputes, payment issues, private conversations

*Remember: Stay calm, be helpful, and when in doubt - escalate!*
