## Intake Process

### When an Item Comes In

1. 📸 **Photo EVERYTHING** before storing
   - Multiple angles
   - Close-up of distinguishing features
   - Include something for scale

2. 🏷️ **Tag with all details**:
   - Item description
   - Location found
   - Time found
   - Finder's name
   - Your initials

3. **Storage by Value**:

| Item Type | Storage Location |
|-----------|------------------|
| 📱 Phones, wallets, jewelry | 🔒 Locked cabinet |
| 👕 Clothing, bags, toys | Regular shelving |
| 🍕 Perishables (food/drinks) | Dispose after 2 hours |

## Matching Process

### When Someone Claims an Item

**Golden Rule: They describe it BEFORE you show it!**

```
1. ASK: "Can you describe the item you lost?"
2. VERIFY: Does description match? (color, brand, contents)
3. CHECK ID: Required for high-value items
4. LOG: Record the claim (successful or not)
5. RELEASE: Have them sign for the item
```

### Why We Verify First

- Prevents false claims
- Protects genuine owners
- Creates paper trail
- Reduces disputes

### High-Value Item Release

For phones, wallets, jewelry, or items worth $50+:

- [ ] Photo ID required
- [ ] ID matches name on item (if visible)
- [ ] Claimant signs release form
- [ ] Note ID number in log

## Where to Look First

**These patterns save hours of searching!**

| Location | Commonly Lost Items | Why |
|----------|--------------------|----|
| 🧊 **Ice Rink** | Mittens, scarves, hats | People take them off when warm |
| 🍔 **Food Court** | Phones, wallets | Set down to eat, forget |
| 👶 **Kids Areas** | Stuffed animals, toys | **URGENT - kids are devastated!** |
| 🎪 **Show Stages** | Glasses, cameras | Put down for better view |
| 🚪 **Exit Areas** | Bags, jackets | Rush to leave |

### Kid's Items = URGENT

- Flag stuffed animals and kid's items as **PRIORITY**
- Kids are often inconsolable
- Check if family is still on grounds
- Page over PA if item found and family still there
- A returned teddy bear = a family's whole day saved

---

## End of Day Process

- [ ] Photo and tag all new items
- [ ] Secure high-value items in locked cabinet
- [ ] Dispose of perishables over 2 hours old
- [ ] Update Lost & Found log
- [ ] Check 30-day items → prepare for charity

## 30-Day Rule

- Items unclaimed after 30 days go to charity
- Exception: High-value items held 60 days
- Document donation with photos
- Keep log for 1 year (in case of late claims)

## Common Scenarios

4. Call them if it turns up

### "My kid lost their stuffed animal!" 😢

1. This is **URGENT** - prioritize!
2. Get detailed description (name, color, size, unique features)
3. Check kids areas immediately
4. Radio all staff to check their areas
5. If not found, take contact info and keep looking

### "I think someone stole it!"

1. Don't accuse or assume theft
