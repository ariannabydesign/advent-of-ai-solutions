## Handling Difficult Customers

### The Golden Rules

1. **Always acknowledge their frustration first**
   - "I completely understand why you're upset"
   - "That sounds really frustrating"
   - Validate BEFORE solving

2. **Offer alternatives, never just say "no"**
   - ❌ "We can't do that"
   - ✅ "Here's what I CAN do for you..."

3. **The 20-Minute Rule**
   - Anyone waiting 20+ minutes gets bumped up
   - Offer a "VIP reading" to recover the experience
   - Turn a complaint into a "wow" moment

### Customer Types & Approaches

| Customer Type | Strategy | Why It Works |
|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 😤 Angry/Frustrated | Acknowledge + Apologize + Alternatives | They feel heard |
| 🤨 Skeptics | "Mysterious stranger" fortune style | Intrigues them despite themselves |
| 👶 Kids under 10 | "Adventure quest" style | Parents LOVE it, kids engaged |
| 💬 Chatty | Offer "extended reading" slot for later | Keeps line moving, they feel special |

## Keeping Lines Moving

### Time Management

- ⏱️ **Target: 2-3 minutes per fortune** - Keep it snappy and magical
- 📋 **Always have 5 pre-written fortunes ready** for rush periods
- 🎯 **Extended readings** - Offer later slots to chatty customers

### Rush Period Protocol

1. Switch to pre-written fortunes
2. Keep interactions warm but brief
3. Offer "come back for extended reading" to those wanting more
4. Call for backup if line exceeds 15 people

## De-escalation Script

```
1. LISTEN - Let them finish, don't interrupt
2. ACKNOWLEDGE - "I understand why you're upset"
3. APOLOGIZE - "I'm sorry this happened to you"
4. SOLVE - "Here's what I can do..."
5. CONFIRM - "Does that work for you?"
```
